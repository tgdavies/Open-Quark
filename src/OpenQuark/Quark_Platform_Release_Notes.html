			<h1><a href="http://labs.businessobjects.com/cal/">Quark Platform</a> Release Notes</h1>
			<h2>1. What's new in the Quark Platform and the CAL Language</h2>
			<H3>version 1.7.2-0 (January 22, 2010)</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				build fixes (primarily for the CAL Eclipse Plug-in) to build and work with Eclipse versions newer than 3.3.
				<LI>
				refactoring of SqlBuilder CAL libraries, and the addition of SqlBuilders for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<H3>version 1.7.1-0 (November 15, 2007)</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					new document: <EM>The Development History of Quark.</EM>
				<LI>
				implementation of the new computer language shootout benchmark ThreadRing.
				<LI>
				enhancements to the ICE manual with examples of using :find and single and 
				multi-threaded debugging.
				<LI>
					memory-use improvement in the CAL runtime
					<UL>
						<LI>
							experimental code generation optimization to reduce memory usage in certain 
							cases by nulling out the last reference to a method argument or local variable. 
							Can be enabled&nbsp;by setting the&nbsp;system property 
							org.openquark.cal.machine.lecc.source_code_space_optimization. There is a 
							similar experimental transformation at the bytecode level in Open Quark 1.7.0. 
							The advantage of the code-generation level optimization is that it is more 
							explicit, and it works both in the lecc source generation mode as well as in 
							the lecc bytecode generation mode.</LI></UL>
				<LI>
					bug fixes
					<UL>
						<LI>
						fixed problems with the Open Quark build scripts in 1.7.0 and made them work 
						with Eclipse 3.3.0.

								details</A>)
						<LI>
						compilation error instead of a runtime error for foreign types in an unnamed 
						(i.e. default) package
						<LI>
							fixed problems with the deployment metadata for gems. They needed resaving to 
							the new format.</LI></UL>

			<h3>version 1.3.0-0 (January 24, 2007)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Quark Platform is now open-sourced under the BSD license!
				<li>
				hierarchical module names e.g. the Prelude module is now called 
				Cal.Core.Prelude (but can still be referred to as Prelude in most contexts). 
				This feature allows for modules to be organized according to ownership, as well 
				as functionality, in a similar way to Java packages. See the CAL User's Guide 
				for details.
				<li>
				new Record Field Selection Gem in the Gem Cutter to easily select fields from a 
				record (without using Code Gems).
				<li>
				improved syntax for CAL foreign functions corresponding to Java non-static 
				methods, non-static fields and constructors avoids redundant re-specification 
				of Java type names.
				<li>
				foreign functions can be created corresponding to Java null values, Java null 
				checks, and Java primitive array operations (creation, subscript, update and 
				length).
				<li>
				foreign types corresponding to Java array types no longer need to use JVM 
				syntax for array names but can use Java source syntax.
				<li>
				new Cal.Core.Record module
				<li>
				added the ability to output(input) a CAL record (or tuple) to(from) a Java map 
				from field-names to values.
				<li>
				strictRecord function for sequencing the fields of a record
				<li>
				Java sources repackaged to the org.openquark namespace (from 
				com.businessobjects)
				<li>
				various improvements to CAL's Java apis. For example, InputPolicy, 
				OutputPolicy, BasicCALServices and EntryPoints are easier to use.
				<li>
				various smaller changes to CAL modules (documented in the CALDoc)
				<li>
					various bug fixes
				</li>

				<li>
					<div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">the Business Activity Monitor sample, which is an 
						extended example of an application program written partially in Java and 
						partially in CAL, is now fully included. It is executable, includes sources, 
						and a document describing how to use the application ("Business Activity 
						Monitor Overview") as well as details about its implementation.
					</div>
				<li>
					<div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Cal.Tutorials.DataProcessing is a new tutorial CAL 
						module showing how to connect to a relational database (in this case the Apache 
						Derby database), perform SQL operations, express the results as CAL records,

						documentation on foreign functions for details.
					</div>
				<li>
					<div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">enhancements to the Prelude.Num type class to better 
						support conversions between CAL's various standard numeric types
					</div>
				<li>
					<div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">CAL Lists can be converted to and from Java 
						Iterators in a lazy fashion. See List.toIterator, List.toIteratorWith, 
						List.fromIterator and List.fromIteratorWith. It simplifies writing Java client 
						code that lazily explores a CAL list. Added examples of this pattern to the 
						EventLoop.java sample.
					</div>
				<li>
					<div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">support for CAL foreign functions making callbacks 
						into CAL to trigger further CAL evaluations. See the Prelude.CalFunction type 
						and the functions Prelude.makeCalFunction and Prelude.evaluatedCalFunction. 
						There are examples of how to use this in Prelude_Tests. For example, one can 
						implement sortByExternal (sorting a CAL list using java.util.Collections.sort 
						which makes call backs to the CAL comparison function a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) 
						using this mechanism without modifying the compiler.

			<p>The Quark Platform download is available at:<a href="http://labs.businessobjects.com/cal">http://labs.businessobjects.com/cal</a>
				Check here for updates and announcements as well.</p>
			<p>The Quark Platform is available under the BSD license. See the license.txt file 
				in the root Quark folder of the zip for the precise license.</p>
			<p>The CAL Eclipse Plug-in is available under the Eclipse Public License. It is a 
				separate download from Quark Platform.</p>
			<p>There is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cal_language">Google Group on the 
					CAL Language and Quark Platform</a>. This is the primary place for 
				discussions, announcements, and questions about CAL and Quark.</p>
			<p>In addition, please feel free to send comments or questions to Luke Evans (<A href="mailto:luke.evans@businessobjects.com">luke.evans@businessobjects.com</A>) 
				or Bo Ilic (<A href="mailto:bo.ilic@businessobjects.com">bo.ilic@businessobjects.com</A>
				).</p>
			<h2>3. System requirements:</h2>
			<p>You need to have Java 5 or greater installed to run Quark. Quark has been tested 
				by us mainly on Windows XP, Linux and Mac OS X, but as a pure Java application 
				may work on other platforms supporting Java&nbsp;5 or greater.</p>
			<p>The generated HTML based CALDoc has been tested and works with the following 
				browsers (current versions unless specified): IE6, IE7, Firefox, Safari, 
				Konqueror.</p>
			<p>These release notes are an HTML file, the other documents are PDFs which can be 
				read using Adobe Reader (http://www.adobe.com/).</p>
			<h2>4. Basic installation:</h2>
			<p>Unzip the open_quark_platform.zip to the directory of your choice. Note that 
				installing on top of a previous&nbsp;version of Open Quark is not 
				supported-&nbsp;the installation directory must be empty.</p>
			<p>In the Quark subfolder there are 4 batch files, which can be used by Windows 
				users to quickly start-up ICE or the Gem Cutter (just double click on the files 
				to launch the application). There are also 4 similarly named .sh files that can 
				be used by Linux or Mac OS users to the same end. There are also 4 .command 
				files for Mac OS users. These are similar to the .sh files but can start the 
				corresponding application on a Mac simply by double clicking.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				ICE.bat - launches ICE with production CAL modules
				<li>
				ICE_Test.bat - launches ICE with production as well as test CAL modules
				<li>
				GemCutter.bat - launches the Gem Cutter with production CAL modules
				<li>
					GemCutter_Test.bat - launches the Gem Cutter with production as well as test 
					CAL modules.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that Java must be accessible from this folder. Alternatively, you can 
				hand-edit the file javacp.bat to specify the precise location of your Java.</p>
			<p>It is possible to deploy Quark in a variety of ways, including entirely using 
				JAR files, but we have shipped this deployment using .cal files that you can 
				modify and experiment with. A JAR based deployment can be generated using the 
				tools we have supplied with this distribution.</p>
			<h2>5. What is included in this distribution:</h2>
			<p>This distribution of the Quark Platform includes the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				ICE- the Interactive CAL Environment. This is an interactive console shell for 
				evaluating CAL expressions, and performing a variety of other operations (such 
				as changing modules, refactoring, search, viewing CALDoc etc). The :h command 
				displays the list of available commands.
				<li>
				GemCutter - a graphical environment for creating, running and testing CAL 
				functions, along with a variety of other UI based tools for accessing various 
				services in the CAL platform, such as refactoring, search, CALDoc generation 
				etc.
				<li>
				Both production as well as test CAL modules are included. These are stored in 
				files with the .cal extension.
				<li>
				The Java API of Quark is included in this distribution as well as the generated 
				Javadoc HTML for this api.
				<li>
				The CAL Eclipse Plug-in- a plug-in for CAL in Eclipse that provides an editor 
				for CAL files supporting syntax highlighting, indenting, and other features. It 
				is not included in the basic Quark_Platform zip but is available as a separate 
				download from the Labs site and has its own release note.
				<li>
				quarkc- the Standalone JAR Tool. This tool produces an independent Java JAR 
				with a main method (corresponding to a designated CAL function), and can be 
				thought of as a compiler for CAL for producing Java JARs that are deployable 
				independently of the Quark framework.
				<li>
					quarklaunch- a launcher for JARs created using quarkc. Effectively this runs 
					the main entry point in a JAR created by quarkc, after first setting the 
					classpath appropriately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following documents are included:</p>
			<UL>
				<li>

				<LI>
					The Development History of Quark</LI></UL>
			<P>The following documents on the implementation of CAL/Quark are included:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					CAL Runtime Internals<EM>-</EM>
				explains how the CAL runtime is implemented, and some of the optimizations 
				used.
				<LI>
					CAL Global Optimizer<EM>-</EM>
				information about an optimization pass of the CAL compiler for doing global 
				optimizations such as inlining and fusion.
				<LI>
					CAL Benchmarking<EM>-</EM>
				an account of various optimizations, and their effects on performance, covering 
				a period of approximately four years.
				<LI>
					Generating DocBook Documentation<EM>-</EM> explains our process for generating 
					documentation in multiple formats (JavaHelp, PDF, HTML, Eclipse Help) from a 
					single&nbsp;DocBook source.</LI></UL>
			<p>In addition, CALDoc HTML generated help is included for the production CAL 
				modules. You can also generate this help yourself from the distribution (and 
				vary the options for generation, such as to include test modules as well), but 
				it is included pre-generated as a convenience.</p>
			<p>There are also 5 videos available on the Labs site. These are a good place to 
				get an end-to-end introduction to what is included in Quark. The videos are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Introduction to Gems and the Gem Cutter (Part 1)
				<li>
				Introduction to Gems and the Gem Cutter (Part 2)
				<li>
				CAL and the Interactive CAL Environment (ICE) Shell
				<li>
				Walkthrough of some Developer Tool Features
				<li>
					CAL Eclipse Plug-in Features</li>
			</ul>
			<p>CAL modules are defined in files with the .cal extension (such as Prelude.cal). 
				They are text files. Both the production and release modules are located in the 
				Quark\bin\cal\debug\CAL subfolder of the install directory. Reading through the 
				code in some of these modules is a good way to familiarize yourself with CAL 
				after learning some of the basics through the documents or videos mentioned 
				above. Note that the production modules should demonstrate reasonable CAL 
				coding practices, but the test modules contain some examples of extreme and 
				unreasonable code, that are intended as unit tests, and not examples of well 
				written CAL code! The distributed CALDoc help only includes the production 
				modules, so you can see which these are, and determine which are of interest to 
				look at.</p>
			<p>In addition, there are some sample modules that contain tutorials:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="http://resources.businessobjects.com/labs/cal/tutorial_calintro.html">Cal.Tutorials.CalIntro</a>
				- a basic tutorial on CAL, not assuming knowledge of functional programming
				<li>
				Cal.Tutorials.CALDoc - writing CAL code with CALDoc
				<li>
				Cal.Tutorials.Fibonnaci - various approaches to writing efficient CAL code
				<li>
				Cal.Tutorials.LocalizedStrings - localizing CAL modules
				<li>
				Cal.Tutorials.QuickCheck - a tutorial on using the QuickCheck module for unit 
				testing CAL code
				<li>
					Cal.Tutorials.DataProcessing - a tutorial on using CAL to access the Apache 
					Derby database, perform SQL operations, express the results as CAL records, and 
					perform various reporting and summarizing operations with those records.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also of note is the CAL modules GemModelDemo and GemModelDemo_Designs. The 
				former shows the CAL text of 4 functions written and the later is automatically 
				generated from designs created in the Gem Cutter. These designs are included in 
				the distribution and can be opened and viewed in the GemCutter by switching to 
				the GemModelDemo_Designs module, locating the desired Gem in the Gem Browser 
				(there are 4 in that module from which to chose), right clicking and selecting 
				"Open Gem Design".</p>
			<p>CAL workspace files are defined in modules with a .cws extension. A CAL 
				workspace is a text file that essentially specifies the collection of modules 
				that should be loaded upon start-up. The production workspaces are in the 
				subfolder "Quark\bin\cal\release\Workspace Declarations" of the install 
				directory, and the test workspaces are in the subfolder 
				"Quark\bin\cal\debug\Workspace Declarations".</p>
			<p>There are also samples of using CAL's Java apis in the samples subfolder of the 
				distribution. The samples are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				GemModelDemo.java -shows the use of our compositional api for creating Gems, as 
				in the GemCutter
				<li>
				SourceModelDemo.java -shows a more language-based apu for creating CAL 
				functions and other entities programmatically
				<li>
					EventLoop.java -shows how CAL lazy computations can be suspended and resumed 
					under a Java client's control</li>
			</ul>
